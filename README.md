### 🧑‍💼 About Me
I’m Ebrahim Tahir, a Business Analytics student at Arizona State University who’s passionate about using data and AI to make businesses work smarter. I like finding ways to connect analytics and strategy — building tools that improve efficiency, cut out repetitive work, and help teams make better decisions.

Most of my projects focus on using analytics and automation to solve real business problems. Whether it’s predicting customer churn or creating AI systems that simplify workflows, I enjoy taking complex data and turning it into something practical that actually drives results.

My goal is to help companies use data and AI not just for analysis, but for integration — creating processes that run smoother, faster, and more intelligently.
